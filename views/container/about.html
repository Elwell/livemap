          <h2>What is this?</h2>
          <p>This application visualizes public transportation vehicles moving through the City of Ulm, Germany. Since the transport authority does not provide
          a useable data feed, we decided to scrape the timetable data and converted them into the <a href="https://code.google.com/intl/de-DE/transit/spec/transit_feed_specification.html">
          GTFS</a> format. We then implemented a simple GTFS parser which emulates the emission of real time event information (though it's based on the static data
          we liberated from their timetable prison. We hope to eventually switch the backend event emitter to realtime data in the future. If anybody out there
          knows someone working at the Stadtwerke Ulm, please prod them a little *nudge nudge*).
          The events emitted by the GTFS parser are consumed by the web application, which renders a map and moves markers according to the estimated location of each vehicle.</p>
          <h2>Why?</h2>
          <p>This application is a contribution to the Node Knockout 2011 by <a href="http://ulmapi.de/">UlmApi.de</a> members.
          We implemented this proof-of-concept prototype within two days. It is intended to demonstrate what is possible by mashing cool technology and open data
          together, shaking it well and letting it boil for a while. It might also prove relaxing to watch. Except if you're using Firefox.</p>
